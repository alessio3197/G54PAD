Compilation and Execution Instruction for G54PAD Assignment 2

Assignment 1 created using Python 3.7.3, although any version of Python 3 should be sufficient 
to run the file.
To run instructions, there are 2 ways the Main() function can take a list of instruction from 
a text file:
	1. Save list of instructions in same directory as shortpaths.py file saved as 
	   'testGraph.txt' and run file from IDLE or cmd/Terminal:
			user@root:Desktop$ python shortpaths.py
	2. Run shortpaths.py from cmd giving the name of text file as first argument, so for 
	   Linux Terminal:
			user@root:Desktop$ python shortpaths.py testGraph.txt

On execution the program will read the information and create an Adjacency List from the inputed 
data in the form of a 2-D linked list. It will then convert this to an Adjacency Matrix as well.
It will then output three things:
	• the adjacency matrix of the graph with the edges given in the file;
	• the result of running Dijkstra’s algorithm, specifying the lengths of the
	  shortest paths from 0 to all other vertices, in the form 0-->i:w;
	• The matrix that gives, for every pair (i,j), the minimum distance from
	  i to j computed by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
