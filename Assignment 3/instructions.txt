Compilation and Execution Instruction for G54PAD Assignment 3

Assignment 3 created using Python 3.7.3, although any version of Python 3 should be sufficient 
to run the file.
To run instructions, there are 2 ways the Main() function can take a list of instruction from 
a text file:
	1. Save list of instructions in same directory as heapRun.py file saved as 
	   'heap0.txt' and run file from IDLE or cmd/Terminal:
			user@root:Desktop$ python heapRun.py
	2. Run heapRun.py from cmd giving the name of text file as first argument, so for 
	   Linux Terminal:
			user@root:Desktop$ python heapRun.py heap0.txt

On execution the program will begin to read input from the given text file, taking a sequence of
instructions, 'insert' (followed by a number to insert), 'extract' ,'minimum', and will perform 
these actions on the Fibonacci heap dynamically.
When given a 'minimum' command the program will output the minimum element of the heap, which is
always stored at the head of the root wheel.

For debugging purposes a 'printHeap' function is included within the source code which allows
the programmer to print the entire heap to the IDLE/cmd.

For any further instruction for use with the solution, please email psyagca@nottingham.ac.uk
