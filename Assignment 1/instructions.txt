Compilation and Execution Instruction for G54PAD Assignment 1

Assignment 1 created using Python 3.7.3, although any version of Python 3 should be sufficient 
to run the file.
To run instructions, there are 2 ways the Main() function can take a list of instruction from 
a text file:
	1. Save list of instructions in same directory as searchtree.py file saved as 
	   'textSearch.txt' and run file from IDLE or cmd/Terminal:
			user@root:Desktop$ python searchtree.py
	2. Run searchtree.py from cmd giving the name of text file as first argument, so for 
	   Linux Terminal:
			user@root:Desktop$ python searchtree.py textSearch.txt
			
Within my solution, 'delete' is not complete. As such I have included two versions of my 
searchtree file:
	1. searchtree.py has my entire solution including partial but not complete delete 
	   functions
	2. searchtree_no_delete.py has all other code except for the delete structure, and for 
	   delete only having an empty function in order for a correct delete structure to be 
	   added for testing purposes
Commenting within the files outlines this as well.
Other than the delete structure, all other submission points have been completed and are 
included within the file,
i.e. solutions are contained for 'search', 'insert', 'checkRB', a data type definition for a 
Node and helper functions.

For any further instruction for use with the solution, please email psyagca@nottingham.ac.uk
